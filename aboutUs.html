                        <p>Mike and Carrie Richards had a vision of providing a unique glamping oasis where the stunning southeastern Utah landscape is enjoyed in modern luxury.
                            They know that people no longer want a one-size-fits all vacation so they've taken their passion for adventure, stewarding and exploring the land and combined it with gardening and promoting indigenous plants, sustainable food and outdoor living.
                            Visitors are welcomed from around the world to experience the natural beauty of Big Rock Candy Mountain with custom packages that include a variety of rental opportunities from river rafting to ATV riding.
                            Enjoy the walkable gardens with landscaping that can be duplicated and provided on your own property with native plants that can make anyone's yard a personal paradise.
                            An overnight stay at Wildland Gardens gives each guest a new spirit of rejuvenation and natural awakening!</p>
